Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at the [Alfred-Weber-Institute for Economics](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/wiso/awi/index_en.html) at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en). I am interested in the empirical analysis of (climatic) disaster impacts on the society. For my research, I use geospatial, climatic and socio-economic data and methods. In November 2020 I submitted my PhD thesis “Geospatial Analysis of Natural Disasters: Economic Impacts, Societal Responses, and Political Bias” which was supervised by [Axel Dreher](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/wiso/awi/professuren/intwipol/dreher.html) and [Eric Strobl](https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/personen/prof_dr_strobl_eric/index_ger.html). 

Please find my current CV [here](https://sven-kunze.github.io/files/CV_SvenKunze_Online.pdf).
