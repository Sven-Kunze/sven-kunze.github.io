Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher analyzing the empirical impacts of (climatic) disasters on society. My research interests range from climate, development, and environmental economics to political economy. For my research, I use geospatial, climatic, and socio-economic data and methods. In April 2021 I defended my PhD thesis [“Geospatial Analysis of Natural Disasters: Economic Impacts, Societal Responses, and Political Bias”](https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00030140) at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/wiso/awi/index_en.html). Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in an [ERA-NET project](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/research/research-database/project-detailview/projektid/4618/) on the impacts of climate change on agricultural land use change in Eurasia.
